    <p>Coffee Roasting Coffee Roasting unpicked coffee berries fresh coffee beans roasted coffee beans commercial coffee roaster A coffeemaker, coffee maker or coffee machine is a cooking appliance used to brew coffee. While there are many different types
        of coffeemakers using several different brewing principles, in the most common devices, coffee grounds are placed into a paper or metal filter inside a funnel, which is set over a glass or ceramic coffee pot, a cooking pot in the kettle family.
        Cold water is poured into a separate chamber, which is then boiled and directed into the funnel. This is also called automatic drip-brew. On August 27, 1930, Inez H. Peirce of Chicago, Illinois filed her patent for the first vacuum coffee maker
        that truly automated the vacuum brewing process, while eliminating the need for a stovetop burner or liquid fuels.[1]</p>

    <p>A cafetiere (Coffee Plunger, French press in US English) requires coffee of a coarser grind than does a drip brew coffee filter, as finer grounds will seep through the press filter and into the coffee.[2] Because the coffee grounds remain in direct
        contact with the brewing water and the grounds are filtered from the water via a mesh instead of a paper filter, coffee brewed with the cafetiere captures more of the coffee's flavour and essential oils, which would become trapped in a traditional
        drip brew machine's paper filters.[3] As with drip-brewed coffee, cafetiere coffee can be brewed to any strength by adjusting the amount of ground coffee which is brewed. If the used grounds remain in the drink after brewing.</p>
