        <blockquote> Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain flowering plants in the Coffea genus. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted green coffee. The seeds
            are then roasted, a process which <a href="roasting.html">roasted</a> them into a consumable product: roasted coffee, which is ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of
            coffee.

        <p>Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, <a href="grinding.html">grinding</a> acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content.[3] It is one of the most popular drinks in the world[4] and can be prepared and presented
            in a variety of ways</p>
    </section>
    <p>The earliest credible evidence of the <a href="brewing.html">brewing</a> of coffee in the form of the modern beverage appears in modern-day Yemen from the middle of the 15th century in Sufi shrines, where coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed
        in a manner similar to current methods.[2] The Yemenis procured the coffee beans from the Ethiopian Highlands via coastal Somali intermediaries and began cultivation. By the 16th century, the drink had reached the rest of the Middle East and North
        Africa, later spreading to Europe.
