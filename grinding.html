    <p>The whole coffee beans are ground, also known as mailing , to facilitate the brewing process</p>

    <p>Instant coffee, also called soluble coffee, coffee crystals, coffee powder, or powdered coffee, is a beverage derived from brewed coffee beans that enables people to quickly prepare hot coffee by adding hot water or milk to the powder or crystals
        and stirring. Instant coffee is commercially prepared by either freeze-drying or spray drying, after which it can be rehydrated. Instant coffee in a concentrated liquid form is also manufactured.</p>

    <p>Advantages of instant coffee include speed of preparation (instant coffee dissolves quickly in hot water), lower shipping weight and volume than beans or ground coffee (to prepare the same amount of beverage), and long shelf lifeâ€”though instant coffee
        can spoil if not kept dry. Instant coffee also reduces cleanup since there are no coffee grounds, and at least one study has found that it has a lower environmental footprint than other preparation methods.[1]</p>

    <p>A concentrated coffee/milk/sugar mixture was produced for the Union army during the American Civil War under the name Essence of Coffee, a teaspoonful of which was mixed with a cup of hot water. It had the consistency of axle grease, and proved so
        unpopular with the troops that it was soon discontinued.[2] The brand Camp Coffee, a coffee and chicory essence, was first produced in 1876 by Paterson & Sons Ltd in Scotland and continues. Photograph of David Strang Coffee Mills Instant or soluble
        coffee was invented and patented in 1890, by David Strang of Invercargill, New Zealand, under patent number 3518[3] sold under the trading name Strang's Coffee[4] citing the patented "Dry Hot-Air" process. Some modern sources have credited French
        humorist and writer Alphonse Allais with the invention.[5][6]</p>

        There are four methods of grinding coffee for brewing:
        <ul>
            <li>Burr-grinding</li>
            <li>Chopping</li>
            <li>Pounding</li>
            <li>Roller Grinding</li>
        </ul>
