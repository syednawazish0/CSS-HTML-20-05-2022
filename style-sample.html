    <p style="text-align: justify;">Khan was born on 2 November 1965 into a Muslim family in New Delhi.[3] He spent the first five years of his life in Mangalore, where his maternal grandfather, Iftikhar Ahmed, served as the chief engineer of the port in the 1960s.[4][5][a] Khan's father,
        Meer Taj Mohammed Khan, was an Indian independence activist from Peshawar who campaigned alongside the Khudai Khidmatgar, a nonviolent resistance movement led by Abdul Ghaffar Khan (also known as Bacha Khan or the "Frontier Gandhi") that sought
        a united and independent India.[7][8] Meer was a follower of Abdul Ghaffar Khan,[9] and affiliated with the Indian National Congress.[10] As of 2010, Khan's paternal family was still living in the Shah Wali Qataal area of Peshawar's Qissa Khwani
        Bazaar.[10] Meer moved to New Delhi in 1948 after the partition of India.[11] Khan's mother, Lateef Fatima, was the daughter of a senior government engineer.[12][b] His parents were married in 1959.[15] Khan described himself on Twitter as "half
        Hyderabadi (mother), half Pathan (father), and some Kashmiri (grandmother)".[16] According to Khan his paternal grandfather, Meer Jan Muhammad Khan, was an ethnic Pashtun (Pathan) from Afghanistan.[17][10][18] His paternal cousins in Peshawar
        claim that the family speaks Hindko and is originally from Kashmir, contradicting the claim that his grandfather was from Afghanistan.</p>
